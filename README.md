# Pi Blade

A 2U high "Blade" center for the Raspberry Pi (or many).

Design inspired by (1) which was inspired by (2) to use the DAP Audio 2 HE Rackblende f. Modulsystem 10 Segmente MP-1 (3), a 2U rack mount system with 10x 44mm wide panels.



## Rack Enclosure

This is the main intended enclosure, if the DAP Audio one isn't available this might be useful, hopefully some add-on bits for the modulsystem as well.

This is made of a number of parts.

* PiRackfrontPanel.svg/dxf - this is a 2U high laser cuttable version of the DAP Audio 2 HE Rackblende f. Modulsystem 10 Segmente MP-1. If you can't get the rack or don't want to wait (or don't mind an acrylic version this might work...

* PiRackRearSide.stl - a 3D printable 1/3 enclosure (side panel). 
** Intended to to around the back of the laser cut panel (not sure how well it will work with the proper rack).
** Print 2x of these, one for each side, then the middle section, these screw to the back of the laser cut acrylic.


## Standalone Enclosure

When getting the Pi's ready you probably don't want to put them in the rack, so this little barn style enclosure allows the blade to be screwed into it to hold it. The Fusion 360 design is scalable to allow multiple units.

* PiBarn-1.stl - 1 blade high
* PiBarn-3.stl - 3 blades high


# Front Panels

These consist of 3D printed panels () and are screwed to the blades.

* McPiFace - is a PCB panel, this can be sent to a fab house such as OSH Park to nicly make the panels.
* Panels from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2759317 can also be used and mounted onto the "Blades"

# Blades

These are the carrier frames for the Pi's. Compatible with https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2759317

* PiRackPiBase.stl - this is the basic Pi blade base.
* PiRackPiLongBase.stl - this will hold 2x Pi's back to back, or HAT base from the Pi Sandwich https://github.com/ThingySticks/PiHatSandwich
** Obviously network connectivity is an issue for the second rear pi when mounting 2x Pi's.
